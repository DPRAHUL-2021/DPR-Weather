# DPReather

DPReather is a simple weather finder web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to quickly search for weather information for a specific city.

## Features:
- Users can enter the name of a city to search for weather information.
- Displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the searched city.
- Provides weather icons representing different weather conditions such as clear, rain, clouds, drizzle, mist, and snow.
- Alerts users with an error message if an invalid city name is entered.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5 for the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS3 for styling the elements and providing a visually appealing interface.
- JavaScript for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the content on the page.
- OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving weather information based on the user's search query.

## How to Use:
1. Enter the name of a city in the search input field.
2. Click the search button or press Enter.
3. The application will display the current weather information for the entered city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. If the entered city name is invalid or not found, an error message will be displayed.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `weather.css`: The CSS file for styling the elements and layout of the web page.
- `weather.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for fetching weather data from the API and updating the DOM based on the retrieved data.
- `clouds.png`, `clear.png`, `drizzle.png`, `mist.png`, `rain.png`, `snow.png`: Weather icons used to represent different weather conditions.

## Usage:
- You can deploy this application to any web server or host it on platforms like GitHub Pages.
- Ensure you have a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace `apiKey` in the `weather.js` file with your API key.
